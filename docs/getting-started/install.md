# Install xlrte
* Download the appropriate build for your platform from our [releases page](https://github.com/xlrte/core/releases/tag/v0.1)
* Rename the downloaded platform specific file to `xlrte`
* Add execute permissions to the binary: `chmod u+x xlrte`
* Put the binary somewhere on your `PATH`, on Mac or Linux for instance `mv xlrte /usr/local/bin/xlrte`

Run `xlrte version` to verify it works. On Mac, you might have to go into `System Preferences > Security & Privacy` and allow the executable to run.
