# Intro

Let's discover **xlrte in less than 10 minutes**.

## Getting Started (Google Cloud)

This walks you through the process of setting up an environment, a simple service, and then incrementally adding a database, some pub/sub topics and cloud storage buckets to the service.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
